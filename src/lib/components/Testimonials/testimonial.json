			"testimonial": "Talk about MOVE FAST. HUMONGOUS shoutout to Nate for exceeding all expectations on another Semgrep Launch. This one is beyond impressive. The client reached out to add more bandwidth to our full sprint capacity to be completed under an extremely tight deadline. As the solo dev, Nate cruised through all of it flawlessly. Nate developed 2 brand new pages, both with several new components in literally 4 days. Semgrep has communicated to me multiple times how impressed and grateful they are for Nate's effort to meet their tight deadline on such short notice. Also - huge thank you to Kiko for helping Nate manage work for his other teams, and everyone else (Chloe, Mo) who contributed to this team win."
